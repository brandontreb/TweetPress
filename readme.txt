Use your Wordpress blog to host the photos you post to Twitter! 

== Description ==

TweetPress is the Wordpress Plug-In that gives you total control and ownership of the photos you post to Twitter, sending traffic back to your own blog, instead of a third party site.

Currently, when posting photos to Twitter, you must first post them to a 3rd party service (such as Twitpic) and then post that URL to Twitter.  Not only do you lose control over YOUR image gallery, but you are also sending Twitpic a significant amount of traffic that could be sent to your own website.

Just install the plugin, and start posting photos with your favorite Twitter client (that supports TweetPress). 

The current Twitter clients that support Tweetpress are Twittelator Pro and Twitter for iPhone

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Download the TweetPress plugin for wordpress
1. Upload it to your wp-content/plugins folder
1. Activate it in your plugin admin page
1. Make sure the directory wp-content/uploads is writable (TweetPress will warn you if it is not)
